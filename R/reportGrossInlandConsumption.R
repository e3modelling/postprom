#' Process and Aggregate Gross Inland Consumption|Biomass and Waste
#'
#' This function processes and aggregates Gross Inland Consumption|Biomass and Waste data from a GDX file,
#' converting it to a standardized format and attaching proper units.
#'
#' @param path The file path to the GDX data file.
#' @param regions A character vector of region names to filter data.
#' @return A magpie object containing processed carbon price data with proper units.
