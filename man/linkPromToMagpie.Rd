\title{Soft-Link OPEN-PROM Outputs to MAgPIE Inputs}
\usage{
linkPromToMagpie(
  path,
  pathPollutantPrices,
  pathBioenergyDemand,
  pathReport = NULL,
  pathSave = NULL,
  forward = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string specifying the file path to the GDX output from OPEN-PROM.}

\item{pathPollutantPrices}{A character string indicating the path to the pollutant prices CSV file used by MAgPIE.}

\item{pathBioenergyDemand}{A character string pointing to the bioenergy demand CSV file for MAgPIE.}

\item{forward}{Logical; if `TRUE`, performs data extraction from OPEN-PROM and reformatting for MAgPIE.
If `FALSE`, executes the reverse linking using `MAgPIE2OPEN()`. Defaults to `TRUE`.}
}
\value{
No return value. Writes updated pollutant prices and bioenergy demand CSVs to disk.
}
\description{
This function facilitates the soft-linking between the OPEN-PROM model and the MAgPIE framework.
It extracts pollutant price and bioenergy demand data from OPEN-PROM outputs and reformats them
into CSV files compatible with MAgPIEâ€™s input structure. Depending on the `forward` flag, the function
can perform either forward linking from OPEN-PROM to MAgPIE or backward linking in the other direction.
}
\details{
- Reads region mappings and variables (e.g., `VmCarVal`, `V03ConsGrssInl`) from the GDX file.
- Aggregates and interpolates missing time periods to generate consistent time-series data.
- Writes two output files: one for pollutant prices and another for bioenergy demand, both for MAgPIE.
- The pollutant prices are modified for the `"co2_c"` pollutant, applying a conversion factor.
- Bioenergy demand is converted from Mtoe to PJ and formatted for compatibility with MAgPIE's data structure.
