\title{Aggregate magpie dimension by hierarchical name levels}
\usage{
helperAggregateLevel(magpie_object, level, dim = 3.1, recursive = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{magpie_object}{A \code{magpie} object to be aggregated.}

\item{level}{Integer specifying the hierarchical depth to retain. All
name components below this level are aggregated. Must be smaller than the
maximum depth present in the data.}

\item{dim}{Numeric dimension identifier of the magpie object to aggregate
(e.g. \code{3.1} for variables). Defaults to \code{3.1}.}

\item{recursive}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), aggregation is performed
directly to the specified level. If \code{TRUE}, aggregation maps for all
intermediate levels between the maximum depth and \code{level} are combined
before aggregation.}
}
\value{
A \code{magpie} object aggregated to the specified hierarchical level.
  If \code{level} is greater than or equal to the maximum depth of the item
  names, the original object is returned unchanged.
}
\description{
Aggregates a magpie object along a given dimension by truncating
pipe-separated (\code{"|"}) item names to a specified hierarchical level.
}
\details{
For example, variables such as
\code{"Secondary Energy|Electricity|Gas|w/o CCS"} and
\code{"Secondary Energy|Electricity|Gas|w/ CCS"} can be aggregated to
\code{"Secondary Energy|Electricity|Gas"} by choosing \code{level = 3}.

The hierarchy is inferred from the number of \code{"|"} separators in the
item names. Aggregation is performed using \code{\link{toolAggregate}}.


Item names are assumed to follow a hierarchical structure separated by
\code{"|"} characters. The function truncates names to the requested level
and aggregates all matching entries accordingly.

Recursive aggregation is mathematically equivalent to direct aggregation and
is mainly intended for compatibility with workflows that explicitly require
multi-level mapping.
